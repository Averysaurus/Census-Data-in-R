# rCensus_workshop
Workshop on fetching and mapping census data with `tidycensus` and `tigris` R packages.

You can download the repo and work through the materials in the file [Rcensus_data_maps-tutorial.html](https://dlab-geo.github.io/rCensus_workshop/Rcensus_data_maps-tutorial.html).

If you have any problems installing and running the packages on your own computer try doing it on [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/), an online environment for running R code.
